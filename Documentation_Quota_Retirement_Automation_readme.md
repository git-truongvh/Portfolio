This documentation is a technical write up of the Quota Retirement Automation I built. The purpose of this documentation was to create a quickly digestible knowledge transfer for other Admins to understand the what, why, and how of the functionality built. The documentation is meant to be brief to make it more appealing to read but detailed enough to answer simple questions about the business problem being solved. The original documentation had links to the relevant JIRA tickets, Solution Design document, and backend components. Runbooks and documentations such as this one increased efficiency by 70% by reducing the time required for hands-on knowledge transfer.
