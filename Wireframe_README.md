This wireframe was created as a no-code mock up of a resource reassignment process. The clients were the Client Strategy Operations team and they were seeking create a standardize process for resource assignment. They wanted front-line managers to be self-served. I utilized a wireframe in order to provide a quick proof of concept without committing any technical resources or committing non-functional code to our preview envrionment. The wireframe gave them confidence in their requirements and enabled us to make revisions prior to coding.
